			Hi, I’m Marco, a polar bear who loves reading. Unfortunately, there is no book written in Bear Language. So I decided to collet children books from different places and learn different languages. My dream is to build a fun place called “Funbrary” for children from all over the world, so they can learn to read, to speak new languages, to share their culture with one another and have fun! I have been traveling around the world and collected over 100 books, each of them is written in multiple languages.</p>
			<p>Now, I invite you to join me to build our Funbrary, a library full of unexpected fun!
